### Josh Schlieder (PI)
Reinhold Schneider (Baden-Baden, May 13, 1903 – Freiburg im Breisgau, April 6, 1958) was a German poet who also wrote novels. Initially his works were less religious, but later his poetry had a Christian and specifically Catholic influence. His first works included ones about Luís de Camões and Portugal.

He had written anti-war poems, which were banned in Nazi Germany. Las Casas (1938) had analysed the ways Christians should respond to state oppression, and had criticised Nazi persecution and anti-Semitism; this led to the ban on publishing his works.

During the war associates of Schneider were in the 'Kreisau Circle' and the 'Freiburger Konzil' which had links with anti-Nazi resistance. His works were still published in Karl Ludwig Freiherr von und zu Guttenbergs journal White Papers and "underground", and tracts were distributed to soldiers at the front. Though he was accused of treason by authoring defeatist literature, the war ended before he could be tried.

### Fennec Fox 
The fennec fox or fennec (Vulpes zerda) is a small nocturnal fox found in the Sahara of North Africa, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Arabian desert. Its most distinctive feature is its unusually large ears, which also serve to dissipate heat. Its name comes from the Berber word (fanak), which means fox, and the species name zerda comes from the Greek word xeros which means dry, referring to the fox's habitat.[2] The fennec is the smallest species of canid. Its coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to high-temperature, low-water, desert environments. Also, its hearing is sensitive enough to hear prey moving underground. It mainly eats insects, small mammals, and birds.
